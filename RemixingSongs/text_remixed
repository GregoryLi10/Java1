road shimmer 
wiggling the vision 
word word caves 
i'm swimming in a mirror 
road shimmer 
wiggling the vision 
word word caves 
i'm swimming in a 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now 
usually i put 
something on tv 
so we never think 
word you word me 
but today i see 
our reflections 
clearly in hollywood 
laying on the screen 
you word need a better life word this 
you need something i can never give 
fake water all across the road 
it's gone now the night has come but 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now 
you can't fight it 
you can't breathe 
you say something so loving but 
now i've got to let you go 
you'll be better off in someone new 
i don't wanna be alone 
you know it hurts me too 
you look so broken when you cry 
one more word then i'll say goodbye 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now 
i word wonder what you're dreaming of 
when you sleep word smile so comfortable 
i word wish that i could give you that 
that look that's perfectly un-sad 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
word caves been faking me out 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now 
sometimes all i think word is you 
late nights in the middle of word 
word caves been faking me out 
can't make you happier now
